# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning

## 📌 Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to classify iris flowers into three species 
(*Setosa*, *Versicolor*, *Virginica*) based on the length and width of their sepals and petals.  

## 📊 Dataset
- Built-in **Iris dataset** from Scikit-learn.  
- 150 samples, 4 features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width).  

## 🛠️ Methodology
1. Import dataset from sklearn.  
2. Data preprocessing and splitting into train-test sets.  
3. Train model (Logistic Regression).  
4. Evaluate performance using accuracy and classification report.  
5. Predict new inputs.  

## 📈 Results
- Accuracy: ~97%  
- Model correctly classifies most flower samples.  

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python  
- Scikit-learn

## ✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates a simple yet effective application of machine learning 
to solve a classification problem. The **Iris dataset** is ideal for beginners 
to understand ML workflow: data preprocessing → model training → evaluation.
